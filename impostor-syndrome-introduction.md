“Don’t worry, you’ll figure it out in time”.  
“It’s just one of those things you figure out how to do.”  
“Give it a few years and you’ll have it figured out”.

It’s just one of those things that we live with. The constant cloud that hangs over us and confronts us at our lowest, worst of times -- “I’m the only one here who doesn’t know what they’re doing.”, “She’s way smarter than me, what am I doing here?”.  
  
Imposter syndrome, feeling like you don’t belong and that you’re a fraud. While not exclusive to, it’s a feeling that’s prevalent in the software industry. That new hire is a whiz when it comes to understanding our testing framework, or the person who has been there just as long as you always seems to be picking up context a bit quicker than you.  

News flash, we’re all thinking the same thing, we all go through it and none of us are talking about it. I wish I had better news, but I don’t. Just know that I’ve been there and that I feel that way often, if it makes you feel any better.  

I won’t go into what causes it, and I won’t go into how to overcome it, but it’s something that’s been covered at length by others and I’d recommend checking out the blogs linked below. But what I would like to share is the beginning of a semi-regular series that documents the things that I’ve screwed up since working on my project, Quartermaster, as an engineer working in FordLabs.  

My hope is to humanize the efforts and blunders that all of us make while doing our best to deliver a great product. Maybe the mistakes we’ve made will seem obvious, perhaps they’ll be something that prevents you from making them in the future. Regardless, I believe that we’re always trying to do what seems right in the given situation -- but hopefully by sharing my honest experiences working in development, you can all feel a little better knowing you didn't screw stuff up as badly as I have.
